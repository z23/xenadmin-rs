# Disposable lab qualification, first live run

This report records the first live XCP-ng runs of the client. Each scenario names the
ledger rows it exercises and separates the observed host behaviour from what remains open.
Raw evidence (sanitized JSON written by the live harness) stays outside the repository.

## Identity

- Application: workspace version 0.17.0, development branch after `86d0565` (CI deadline
  scaling and lab harness changes merged to main).
- Lab: three nested KVM guests from the [harness manifest](../../lab/README.md), manifest
  `9e8e4f49`, isolated libvirt network without forwarding, hosts installed unattended
  from `xcp-ng-8.3.0-20260806.iso` (SHA-256
  `1d06e2d88a0fbf9a38384aa46637fd5d1ad568ba0df7ab3ed95fb047655f22e6`, publisher checksum
  list signature verified against the documented XCP-ng key fingerprint).
- Hosts report product version 8.3.0. Each host has a 64 GiB SATA system disk with a local
  EXT repository and an untouched 32 GiB SATA data disk.
- Workstation: Linux 7.2.15 (Arch-derived), libvirt 12.8.0, QEMU 11.1.2, AMD nested KVM.
- Live harness: `crates/xenadmin-core/tests/lab_live.rs`, run with the manifest and a
  lab-only password file; targets come only from the manifest.

## Workstation prerequisites found during setup

- Cloudflare WARP captured every destination through a policy-routing table consulted
  before the main table and dropped non-tunnel traffic in its own nftables input and
  output chains. The lab could not fetch answer files or reach XAPI until WARP was
  disconnected. The harness now verifies that every lab address resolves to the lab
  bridge after the bridge exists.
- ufw's default policy dropped DHCP requests to the bridge without logging them (its
  after-rules skip DHCP ports). Rules allowing the bridge, DHCP and the answer-file port
  were required.

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Rows | Result | Observation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct recovery, read-only | P01-01, P01-11, P01-13, P19-01 | Passed | Credential-free certificate inspection, exact-endpoint pin, read-only login and current inventory on all three standalone hosts; wrong pins and the untrusted self-signed certificate were refused before any credential was sent |
| Reviewed pool join | P13-02 | See findings | First attempt refused locally; see below |

## Findings

1. **`host.list_methods` is not implemented on XCP-ng 8.3.0.** The host answers
   NOT_IMPLEMENTED. The join and security-operation reviews treated the missing method
   catalogue as proof that the operation was unsupported and refused before dispatch.
   They now treat an unimplemented catalogue as "cannot pre-verify" and let the server's
   own explicit refusal of unknown methods remain authoritative; an explicitly empty
   catalogue still refuses. The security overview already reported the catalogue error
   rather than failing. Fixture coverage was added for both paths.
2. **A joined member is briefly not live.** After `pool.join` the member restarts its
   toolstack; the coordinator reports it disabled and not live for roughly half a minute.
   Post-join verification failed on the first read and left the operation unknown. It now
   keeps re-reading within its timeout; an operator recheck through the destination
   connection still resolves a late case. Fixture coverage was added.

## Limitations

This run used the core facade through the live harness, not the Rune desktop window.
Native desktop, console input, guest data integrity and the remaining ledger rows are
recorded as they are exercised.
